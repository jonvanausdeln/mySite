I am a person, a father, and an engineer.  But I can't be contained by those simple constraints.
For this exercise in "*aboutness*" it will be kept a little more focused.

## Professional
I am commonly referred to as a Software QA Engineer, or a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). Basically, I try to make the products the best they can be by breaking them.  I do that with other software.  Hence the "Software" part of the descriptor.

I've been doing this for a long time (25 years at this point), so I have lots of opinions. Many of them are good, and I'm sure some are not.  They are solely my opinions, so don't ever construe them as being more than that.

# Personal
Those who know... Know.  While things I may put on this site might have a personal flair, I won't be doing it too much. 

End of Line.
