For this exercise in “aboutness” it will be kept a little more focused.\n\nProfessional\nI am commonly referred to as a Software QA Engineer, or a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). Basically, I try to make the products the best they can be by breaking them. I do that with other software. Hence the “Software” part of the descriptor.\nI’ve been doing this for a long time (25 years at this point), so I have lots of opinions. Many of them are good, and I’m sure some are not. They are solely my opinions, so don’t ever construe them as being more than that.\n\n\nPersonal\nThose who know… Know. While things I may put on this site might have a personal flair, I won’t be doing it too much.\nEnd of Line.\n      \n      \n      \n          \n    \n    What I'm Reading\n    \n      \n          \n            \n          \n          \n            Wolves Among the Stars\n          \n          \n            by J.N.
