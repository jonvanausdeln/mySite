Basically, I try to make the products the best they can be by breaking them. I do that with other software. Hence the “Software” part of the descriptor.\nI’ve been doing this for a long time (25 years at this point), so I have lots of opinions. Many of them are good, and I’m sure some are not. They are solely my opinions, so don’t ever construe them as being more than that."
