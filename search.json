All us nerds flocked to livestreams, blogs, whatever we could get our grubby Dorito-covered hands on the quickest.\nWe stare slack-jawed at our screens, waiting for the supreme leader nerds to give us‚Ä¶ what? Really, what? What is it that we need now?\nI have the answer‚Ä¶ not a new phone. It‚Äôs time for all of us hunchback monkeys to come to grips with a simple fact: Phones are really good now. Whatever neat-o new things the ghost of Jobs adds just isn‚Äôt that big a deal anymore. Not one of us can squint through our dirty coke bottle lenses and see one bit of difference from the last screen resolution to this one. The packages go from bigger to smaller, back to bigger. From thick to thin, back to thick again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Just stop. Please stop.\nWhat we all really need? The small tweaks that make things easier. Bug fixes. Fix all the little things that really piss us off, but we‚Äôve come to just accept. I‚Äôll go first. When I‚Äôm connected to my car, and want to take a screenshot of whatever is on my PHONE screen, I don‚Äôt need said screen capture to include the map I have up on my car infotainment center.\nOr how about you just lower the price? Make it more affordable. Better the environment. Something to actually help us all‚Ä¶ not cram another shiny toy at us that gives all the youths FOMO if mommy or daddy (not the sugar variety) don‚Äôt run out right away and drop a rack on it.\nJust stop."

    "section": "The Solution",
    "text": "The Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  While saying it‚Äôs AI would be appropriate, it‚Äôs not the complete solution. As per my usual, I‚Äôm not going to go into great detail, but you should get the idea. There‚Äôs some thought you need to put into it, but Skynet helps\n\n\n\nKick Rocks\nIf you aren‚Äôt familiar with Obsidian, you should hit the link up there and check it out. TLDR ~ It‚Äôs all based on markdown documents and an engine to render the markdown. Being all text files makes it easier for our good buddy Claude to do it‚Äôs thang.\nI use the core Daily notes and Templates extensions, and also tasks and templater community extensions. I set up a daily note template that is very regimented. Bonus - ask Claude to help setup the template\nHere is my example\n\n---\ndate: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}\ntags: [work, daily]\n---\n# {{date:dddd, MMMM D, YYYY}}\n\n## What I need to do Today\n\n&gt; [!info] Previous Tasks\n&gt;```tasks\n&gt; not done\n&gt; created before today\n&gt;```\n\n## What I did Today\n```tasks\ndone on today\n```\n### Issues Verified\n\n## Meetings\n\n## Misc Notes\n\nThe Previous Tasks uses the tasks extension to pull in things I didn‚Äôt finish to the top. And I have separate files for each meeting, but this gives me a place to quickly take notes, then add them to the meeting note later.\nThen comes the weekly roundup. Again a template.. and I again suggest letting the machines draft something that is most efficient for it. This is also a template only used by the ai agent (I‚Äôll get to that later).\n\n---\ndate:\n  \"{ date:YYYY-MM-DD }\": \nweek:\n  \"{ date:YYYY-'W'ww }\": \ntags:\n  - summary\n  - weekly\n---\n# Weekly Task Summary: {{date:MMMM D, YYYY}} - {{date+7d:MMMM D, YYYY}}\n\n## Completed Tasks\n\n### {{date:dddd, MMMM D}}\n- \n\n### {{date+1d:dddd, MMMM D}}\n- \n\n### {{date+2d:dddd, MMMM D}}\n- \n\n### {{date+3d:dddd, MMMM D}}\n- \n\n### {{date+4d:dddd, MMMM D}}\n- \n\n## Key Accomplishments\n- \n\n## Issues Verified\n- \n\n## PRs/Contributions\n- \n\n## Notes for Next Week\n- \n\nI like having each day explained, and then some summaries.\n\n\nNow the Magic happens\nBefore unleashing the beast, you need to give it guardrails.\nYou‚Äôll notice a theme at this point.. ask Claude to create the CLAUDE.md file to use as instructions. Be nice and descriptive about what you want it summarize and how. I‚Äôm not posting all of mine here, but here is the section telling it how to find completed work:\n\n## Task Summary Generation\n\nWhen you need to look for completed and uncompleted tasks:\n\n1. Look for completed tasks in these locations:\n   - Daily Notes folder\n   - Any project-specific files in the `Projects` folder.\n   - Action items in meeting notes (found in the `Meetings` folder)\n\n2. Count the following as completed tasks:\n   - Markdown checkboxes with `- [x]` format\n   - Items listed under \"What I've done\" or \"Completed\" sections\n   - There may be duplicates, those should only be counted once.\n\nYou will have several iterations of the templates and these instructions. So now I startup Claude Code in my Obsidian vault and ask it for a weekly summary. After some machinations, it spits out a new weekly summary markdown to use as my ‚Äòstatus‚Äô report. I‚Äôve come to find it very handy also to summarize my day and help me plan what to attack next.\nLike most things, it will probably always be a work in progress. I just recently asked Claude how to optimize the process for speed and cost. It gave me several ideas I need to implement."

But I am still in control. That‚Äôs the key.\nA few things I‚Äôve learned:\n\nThere is an Obsidian MCP extension out there (maybe two), but I found it slower and more costly than just letting Claude Code parse through the file system itself. It was about 20% faster, and about 1/2 the cost when just using its built-in tools and parsing the markdown files.\nBe clear and explicit in the claude.md instruction file. Tell it where to look and where NOT to look for the information\nExplicitly tell Claude how to do some actions, such as writing small scripts to parse .md files for the task syntax. Basically providing it very small tools catered toward this specific task.\n\nFuture Improvements:\n\nHave it do more file organization for me. Such as moving past weeks notes into some archive folder structure.\nClaude should be able to parse out the files and help me organize my thoughts.. look for patterns in my thinking and then help me come up with better directions for my problem solving.\nHook in the Github MCP server so it can pull more details for GH issues I work on.. allowing me to keep better notes about what I find."
