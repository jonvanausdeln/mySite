## 🚨🚨  NERD ALERT 🚨🚨
:::

Once again the 🍎 📱 is all the rage. All us nerds flocked to livestreams, blogs, whatever we could get our grubby Dorito-covered hands on the quickest.

We stare slack-jawed at our screens, waiting for the supreme leader nerds to give us... what? Really, what? What is it that we need now?

I have the answer... not a new phone. It's time for all of us hunchback monkeys to come to grips with a simple fact: Phones are really good now. Whatever neat-o new things the ghost of Jobs adds just isn't that big a deal anymore. Not one of us can squint through our dirty coke bottle lenses and see one bit of difference from the last screen resolution to this one. The packages go from bigger to smaller, back to bigger. From thick to thin, back to thick again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Just stop. Please stop.

What we all really need? The small tweaks that make things easier. Bug fixes. Fix all the little things that really piss us off, but we've come to just accept. I'll go first. When I'm connected to my car, and want to take a screenshot of whatever is on my **PHONE** screen, I don't need said screen capture to include the map I have up on my car infotainment center.

Or how about you just lower the price? Make it more affordable. Better the environment. Something to actually help us all... not cram another shiny toy at us that gives all the youths FOMO if mommy or daddy (not the sugar variety) don't run out right away and drop a rack on it. 

Just stop.
